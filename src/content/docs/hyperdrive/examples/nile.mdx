This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [Nile](https://thenile.dev) PostgreSQL database instance.

Nile is PostgreSQL re-engineered for multi-tenant applications. Nile's virtual tenant databases provide you with isolation, placement, insight, and other features for your tenant's data and embedding. Refer to [Nile documentation](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/getting-started/whatisnile) to learn more.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Cloudflare Hyperdrive to any Nile database in your workspace using its connection string - either with new set of 
credentials or using existing set.

### Nile Console

To get a connection string from Nile Console:

1. Log in to [Nile Console](https://console.thenile.dev) and select a database 
2. On the left hand menu, click on "Settings" (the bottom-most icon) and then select "Connection"
3. Click on the elephant, and you'll see a connection string show up. 
4. If you want a new pair of credentials for use with Cloudflare Hyperdrive (recommended!), click on "Generate credentials".
5. Copy the connection string without the "psql" part

You'll end up with a connection string similar to this:

```txt
    postgres://0191c898-...:4d7d8b45-...@eu-central-1.db.thenile.dev:5432/my_database
```

With the connection string, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.
